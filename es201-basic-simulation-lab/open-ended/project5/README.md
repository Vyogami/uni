# Github Repo: Image Manipulation in Matlab/Octave

<p>Read a gray scale image in Matlab/Octave. </p><p>Obtain a negative of a gray scale image.  Plot the original image and its negative.</p><p>Also plot the image after brightening and darkening it. Use subplot.</p><p></p>

## Problem Definition

The aim of this project is to provide code for basic image manipulation operations in Matlab/Octave.

### Problem Scope

The project deals with basic image manipulation operations that can be performed using Matlab/Octave.

### Technical Review

The code is written in Matlab/Octave and uses built-in functions to perform various operations on images.

### Design Requirements

The following design requirements were identified for the project:

- The code should be written in Matlab/Octave.
- The code should be well documented and easy to understand.
- The code should provide basic image manipulation operations.

## Design Description

### Overview

The project provides code for basic image manipulation operations such as thresholding, negative transformation, brightness and darkness adjustment.

### Detailed Description

The project contains the following files:

- `README.md`: provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.
- `Nemo.PNG`: a color (RGB) image used for demonstrating basic image manipulation operations.
- `cameraman.tif`: a grayscale image used for demonstrating basic image manipulation operations.
- `thresholding.m`: contains code for thresholding a color image and converting it to a binary image.
- `negative_transformation.m`: contains code for obtaining the negative of a grayscale image.
- `brightness_and_darkness_adjustment.m`: contains code for brightening and darkening a grayscale image.

### Use

The project can be used to perform basic image manipulation operations using Matlab/Octave.

## Evaluation

### Overview
