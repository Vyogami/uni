## Problem definition

The aim of this project is to read a color (RGB) image in Matlab/Octave and process it to obtain a binary image that can be used for further analysis or applications. The specific tasks involved in the project are:

- Reading the RGB image and displaying its red, green, and blue channels on separate plots
- Selecting a suitable channel for thresholding the foreground and plotting its histogram
- Using thresholding to convert the image to a binary image and displaying it

### Technical Review

The implementation uses basic image processing techniques in Matlab/Octave to read a color image, plot its color channels, threshold an appropriate channel, and convert the image to a binary image. The code is simple and easy to understand.

## Design Requirements

- Read a color (RGB) image in Matlab/Octave
- Plot the red, green and blue channel on separate plots using subplot
- Select a suitable channel for thresholding the foreground
- Plot the histogram of the selected channel
- Use thresholding to convert the image to a binary image
- Display the binary image

## Design Description

### Overview

The implementation reads a color image in Matlab/Octave and plots its color channels on separate plots using the `subplot` function. It then selects a suitable channel for thresholding based on the image characteristics and plots its histogram using the `imhist` function. Finally, it applies thresholding to the selected channel to convert the image to a binary image and displays the result using the `imshow` function.

### Detailed Description

1. Read the color image using the `imread` function
2. Plot the red, green, and blue channels on separate plots using the `subplot` function and `imshow` function
3. Select a suitable channel for thresholding based on the image characteristics
4. Plot the histogram of the selected channel using the `imhist` function
5. Apply thresholding to the selected channel using a threshold value and the `>` operator
6. Convert the thresholded channel to a binary image and display the result using the `imshow` function

### Use

The implementation can be used for basic image processing tasks such as image thresholding and binary image conversion. It can also serve as a starting point for more advanced image processing tasks that involve color channels and histograms.

## Evaluation

### Overview

The implementation is evaluated based on its ability to read a color image, plot its color channels, select a suitable channel for thresholding, plot the histogram of the selected channel, apply thresholding to the selected channel, and convert the image to a binary image.

### Prototype

The implementation has been tested on Matlab R2021a and Octave 6.2.0 on Windows 10. The input image used for testing is Nemo.PNG.

### Testing and Results

The implementation was tested by running the code and visually inspecting the results. The output was compared to the expected results based on the input image characteristics.

The results showed that the implementation successfully read the color image, plotted its color channels, selected a suitable channel for thresholding, plotted the histogram of the selected channel, applied thresholding to the selected channel, and converted the image to a binary image.

### Assessment

The implementation meets the design requirements and provides a simple and easy-to-understand solution for basic image processing tasks. However, it may not be suitable for more complex tasks that require advanced image processing techniques.

### Next Steps

Future work may involve improving the implementation to handle more complex image processing tasks or integrating it with other image processing libraries or tools.
