# Basic Simulation Lab - Lab Experiments

This directory contains the code and experiment reports for the Basic Simulation Lab course at Amity University.

## Structure

The directory is organized into separate subdirectories for each lab experiment. Each subdirectory contains:

- `experimentX.m`: the MATLAB code for the experiment
- `experimentX-observations.pdf`: a PDF file containing the results of running the experiment
- `README.md`: a report summarizing the approach and results for the experiment

### Example

``` yaml
experiment1/
├── experiment1.m
├── experiment1-observations.pdf
└── README.md
```

## Experiment Aims

1. Aim 1
2. Aim 2
3. Aim 3

## References

The `references/` directory contains reference materials for the course, including relevant PDFs and other documentation, such as:

- [`previous-year-practical-file.pdf`](./references/previous-year-practical-file.pdf): a PDF file containing the previous year's practical file

For further information, please refer to the individual `README.md` files located in the subdirectories for each experiment.
