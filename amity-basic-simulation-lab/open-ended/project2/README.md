## Problem Definition

The aim of this project is to create a multiplayer game that simulates rolling two dice. The program will ask the user to input the number of players and then simulate the rolling of two dice for each player. The winner of each round will be the player with the highest score, and the overall winner will be the player who wins the most rounds. The program will display the winner of each round and the overall winner(s).

## Problem Scope

The program will be designed to handle at least two players and simulate rolling of two dice for each player. The program will then calculate the total score for each player and determine the winner of each round based on the highest score. The program will continue for 5 rounds, and the overall winner(s) will be the player(s) with the highest number of round wins.

## Technical Review

The program will use basic programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and random number generation. The random number generation will be implemented using the `randi` function, and the program will not require any external libraries.

## Design Requirements

The program should adhere to the following requirements:

- Ask the user to input the number of players (at least 2).
- Simulate rolling two dice for each player in alternate turns for each of the 5 rounds.
- Calculate the total score for each player for each round.
- Determine the winner of each round based on the highest score.
- Display the winner of each round.
- Determine the overall winner(s) based on the highest number of round wins.
- Display the overall winner(s).

## Design Description

### Overview

The program will begin by asking the user to input the number of players. It will then simulate rolling two dice for each player in alternate turns for each of the 5 rounds. The program will calculate the total score for each player for each round and determine the winner of each round based on the highest score. The winner of each round will be displayed, and the program will continue for the next round. At the end of the 5 rounds, the program will determine the overall winner(s) based on the highest number of round wins and display the result.

### Detailed Description

1. The program will begin by asking the user to input the number of players (at least 2).
2. The program will initialize player scores and overall scores to zero.
3. The program will simulate rolling two dice for each player in alternate turns for each of the 5 rounds.
4. For each turn, the program will generate two random integer numbers between 1 and 6 to simulate rolling of two dice.
5. The program will calculate the total score for each player for each round.
6. The program will update the player score and overall score for each player.
7. The program will find the winner of each round based on the highest score.
8. The winner of each round will be displayed.
9. The program will reset player scores for the next round.
10. At the end of the 5 rounds, the program will find the overall winner(s) based on the highest number of round wins.
11. The overall winner(s) will be displayed.

### Use

To use the program, the user should follow these steps:

1. Run the program.
2. Input the number of players (at least 2).
3. The program will simulate rolling two dice for each player in alternate turns for each of the 5 rounds.
4. The program will display the winner of each round.
5. At the end of the 5 rounds, the program will display the overall winner(s).

## Evaluation

### Overview

The program was tested using MATLAB R2020a on a Windows 10 machine.

### Prototype

The program was implemented and tested successfully.

### Testing and Results

The program was tested using various inputs, and it worked as expected. The program generated two random integer numbers between 1 and 6 to simulate the rolling of two dice, and the winner of each round and overall winner(s) were determined correctly.

### Assessment

The program met all the requirements and performed as expected. The code is well-documented and easy to understand.

### Next Steps

Future improvements could include adding a graphical user interface (GUI) and allowing the user to choose the number of rounds to be played.
