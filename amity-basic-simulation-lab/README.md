# Basic Simulation Lab

This directory contains the code and experiment reports for the Basic Simulation Lab course at Amity University.

## [Lab Experiments](./lab/README.md)

The `lab/` directory contains the code and report files for each lab experiment. The experiments are organized into separate subdirectories, each containing an experiment file (`experimentX.m`), a results file (`experimentX_results.pdf`), and a README file (`README.md`) acting as the experiment report.

Here is an example of the structure for experiment 1:

``` yaml
lab/
├── experiment1/
│   ├── experiment1.m
│   ├── observations.pdf
│   └── README.md
```

The `README.md` file in each experiment directory should contain a brief description of the experiment and any instructions needed to run the code, as well as the results and observations.

## [Open-Ended Projects](./open-ended/README.md)

The `open-ended/` directory contains the code and report files for the open-ended projects. The projects are organized into separate subdirectories, each containing a question file (`projectX.m`), a results file (`projectX_results.pdf`), and a README file (`README.md`) acting as the project report.

Here is an example of the structure for project 1:

``` yaml
open-ended/
├── question1/
│   ├── project1.m
│   ├── observations.pdf
│   └── README.md
```

The `README.md` file in each question directory should contain a brief description of the question and any instructions needed to run the code, as well as the results and observations.

## References

The [`syllabus.pdf`](syllabus.pdf) contains the syllabus and course structure of Basic simulation lab. Also the `lab/references/` and `open-ended/references/` directories contain reference materials for the course, including relevant PDFs and other documentation.
